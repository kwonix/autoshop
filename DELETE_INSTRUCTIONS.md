# 🗑️ Cleanup Instructions

## Files Identified for Deletion

After migrating to Docker, these files are obsolete:

### 1. `deploy.sh`
- **Purpose:** Old bash deployment script for manual PM2 + Nginx setup
- **Status:** ❌ OBSOLETE
- **Reason:** Replaced by Docker Compose and management scripts
- **Size:** ~5 KB

### 2. `.dist/` directory
- **Purpose:** Unknown/empty distribution folder
- **Status:** ❌ OBSOLETE  
- **Reason:** Not used by Docker deployment, currently empty
- **Size:** 0 bytes

## 🚀 How to Clean Up

### Option 1: Automated Cleanup Script

**Windows:**
```cmd
cleanup.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deletion

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
del deploy.sh
rmdir /s /q .dist
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Remove-Item deploy.sh
Remove-Item .dist -Recurse -Force
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
rm deploy.sh
rm -rf .dist/
```

### Option 3: Git Removal (If Tracked)

```bash
git rm deploy.sh
git rm -r .dist/
git commit -m "chore: remove obsolete deployment files after Docker migration"
```

## ✅ Verification After Cleanup

After deleting files, verify everything works:

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Test application
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

All services should start normally!

## 📊 Before and After

### Before Cleanup:
```
autoshop/
├── deploy.sh           ← DELETE THIS
├── .dist/              ← DELETE THIS
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── ...
```

### After Cleanup:
```
autoshop/
├── docker-compose.yml  ✓
├── Dockerfile          ✓
├── docker-manager.sh   ✓
├── docker-manager.bat  ✓
├── QUICKSTART.md       ✓
├── ...
```

## 💾 Backup (Optional)

If you want to keep the old deployment script as reference:

```bash
# Create backup before deletion
mkdir -p ../autoshop-backup
cp deploy.sh ../autoshop-backup/
cp -r .dist ../autoshop-backup/
```

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Cleaner codebase** - No conflicting deployment methods  
✅ **Less confusion** - Single deployment approach (Docker)  
✅ **Better maintainability** - Easier for new developers  
✅ **Smaller repository** - Less clutter  

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- These files are safe to delete with Docker deployment
- You can always restore from Git history if needed
- Docker is now the primary deployment method
- All old functionality is available through Docker
